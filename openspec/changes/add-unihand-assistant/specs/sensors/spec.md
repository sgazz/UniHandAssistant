## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Gyroscope Integration
The system SHALL integrate gyroscope sensor for device orientation detection.

#### Scenario: Gyroscope activation
- **WHEN** Move function is activated
- **THEN** gyroscope sensor is enabled
- **AND** device orientation is monitored
- **AND** orientation data is processed for image movement

### Requirement: Accelerometer Integration
The system SHALL integrate accelerometer sensor for device tilting detection.

#### Scenario: Accelerometer activation
- **WHEN** Move function is activated
- **THEN** accelerometer sensor is enabled
- **AND** device tilting is monitored
- **AND** tilting data is processed for image movement

### Requirement: Move Functionality
The system SHALL provide image movement based on device tilting using gyroscope and accelerometer data.

#### Scenario: Forward tilt movement
- **WHEN** user tilts device away from themselves
- **THEN** image moves down slowly
- **AND** movement is smooth and continuous
- **AND** movement speed is configurable

#### Scenario: Backward tilt movement
- **WHEN** user tilts device towards themselves
- **THEN** image moves up slowly
- **AND** movement is smooth and continuous
- **AND** movement speed is configurable

#### Scenario: Left tilt movement
- **WHEN** user tilts device to the left
- **THEN** image moves left slowly
- **AND** movement is smooth and continuous
- **AND** movement speed is configurable

#### Scenario: Right tilt movement
- **WHEN** user tilts device to the right
- **THEN** image moves right slowly
- **AND** movement is smooth and continuous
- **AND** movement speed is configurable

### Requirement: Move Combinations
The system SHALL support configurable movement combinations for different user preferences.

#### Scenario: Standard combinations
- **WHEN** user selects standard combination mode
- **THEN** forward tilt moves image down
- **AND** backward tilt moves image up
- **AND** left tilt moves image left
- **AND** right tilt moves image right

#### Scenario: Opposite combinations
- **WHEN** user selects opposite combination mode
- **THEN** forward tilt moves image up
- **AND** backward tilt moves image down
- **AND** left tilt moves image right
- **AND** right tilt moves image left

### Requirement: Sensitivity Configuration
The system SHALL provide configurable sensitivity for Move function.

#### Scenario: Low sensitivity
- **WHEN** user selects low sensitivity
- **THEN** device tilting requires more movement
- **AND** image movement is more gradual
- **AND** fine control is easier

#### Scenario: High sensitivity
- **WHEN** user selects high sensitivity
- **THEN** device tilting requires less movement
- **AND** image movement is more responsive
- **AND** quick adjustments are easier

### Requirement: Sensor Optimization
The system SHALL optimize sensor usage for battery efficiency.

#### Scenario: Sensor activation
- **WHEN** Move function is activated
- **THEN** sensors are enabled
- **AND** sensor data is processed efficiently
- **AND** battery usage is optimized

#### Scenario: Sensor deactivation
- **WHEN** Move function is deactivated
- **THEN** sensors are disabled
- **AND** battery usage is minimized
- **AND** system resources are freed
